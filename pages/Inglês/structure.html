                <h1>Structure of the Animal Cell</h1>
                <p>
                    The animal cell has a variety of different structures. It contains many different types of specialized organelles that perform all of its functions. Not all animal cells have all types of organelles, but, in general, animal cells contain most, if not all, of the following organelles.

                <h2>Nucleus</h2>
                <p>
                    The nucleus is the region of the cell where the genetic material (DNA) of the animal cell is found. It is considered a membranous cellular organelle, that is, it has an envelope similar to the plasma membrane. The existence of this envelope means that the genetic material is stored inside.

                <h2>Nucleolus</h2>
                <p>
                    The nucleolus is a cellular structure that is present in the nucleus of the animal cell. In each nucleus there is usually only one nucleolus. The nucleolus is one of the most important organelles present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. In the nucleolus of cells, ribosomal RNAs are produced. Therefore, the most important function of these structures is to assist in the production of RNA.

                <h2>Plasma Membrane</h2>
                <p>
                    The plasma membrane or cell membrane is a category of cellular organelle. It is a thin, porous, and microscopic envelope. The plasma membrane is a semi-permeable structure, responsible for the transport and selection of substances that enter and leave the cell. This is why it is of extreme importance for cellular metabolism.

                <h2>Cytoplasm</h2>
                <p>
                    The cytoplasm is the region of the cell where the nucleus and organelles are found, in addition to other structures with specific functions. It is formed by a fluid substance consisting mainly of water, proteins, mineral salts, carbohydrates, and cellular organelles. The cytoplasm is essential for keeping the cell alive, as it creates a favorable environment where chemical reactions, the transport, and the storage of important substances occur.

                <h2>Ribosomes</h2>
                <p>
                    Ribosomes are small, granule-shaped structures that are present in animal cells. The function of ribosomes is to assist in the production and synthesis of proteins in the cells. In addition to it, DNA and RNA molecules participate in this process.

                <h2>Endoplasmic Reticulum</h2>
                <p>
                    The endoplasmic reticulum is a membranous organelle related to the production of organic molecules. There are 2 types of reticulum: the smooth and the rough, both have distinct shapes and functions. The rough one has ribosomes on its external walls and is responsible for protein synthesis, while the smooth one is responsible for the production of lipids. The reticulums are membranous structures composed of flattened sacs located in the cell's cytosol.

                <h2>Golgi Complex</h2>
                <p>
                    The Golgi Complex or Golgi Apparatus, or even Golgi, is an organelle of animal cells, composed of flattened and stacked membranous discs. Its functions are to modify, store, and export proteins synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and, in addition, it gives rise to lysosomes and the acrosomes of sperm.

                <h2>Lysosomes</h2>
                <p>
                    Lysosomes are spherical structures delimited by a membrane formed by a lipoprotein layer. These organelles contain many enzymes that allow them to degrade a large number of substances. The enzymes are peptidases (digest amino acids), nucleases (digest nucleic acids), lipases (digest lipids), among others. Since these hydrolase enzymes work in an acidic environment, digestion occurs inside the lysosomes to not harm the cell.

                <h2>Mitochondria</h2>
                <p>
                    Its function is to produce most of the cells' energy, through the process called cellular respiration. The size, shape, quantity, and distribution of mitochondria vary according to the type of cell. They also have their own genetic material. Now explaining what cellular respiration is. Cellular respiration is a process of oxidation of organic molecules, such as fatty acids and carbohydrates, especially glucose, which is the main source of energy used by heterotrophic organisms.

                <h2>Centrioles</h2>
                <p>
                    It is a type of cytoplasmic organelle that performs a very important function in animal cells. Centrioles are cellular structures that assist in cell division (mitosis and meiosis). They therefore have the ability to duplicate during the cell division cycle, organizing the achromatic spindle. After the duplication process, the centrioles migrate towards the poles of the cell. In addition, they assist in the formation of cilia and flagella.

                <h2>Peroxisomes</h2>
                <p>Peroxisomes perform important functions inside the cells, since they contain digestive enzymes responsible for oxidizing organic substances. Peroxisomes are small, rounded structures which are surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane. Inside, they contain oxidase enzymes, responsible for the oxidation of substances.

                <h2>Digestive Vacuoles</h2>
                <p>These vacuoles perform intracellular digestion and are present in protozoa and in animal and human cells such as macrophages. Inside the digestive vacuole, the lysosome enzymes will perform digestion and then the remains will be eliminated from the cell. In the defense cells of the human body, a similar situation occurs. Invasive agents, for example bacteria or viruses, are phagocytosed and digested inside the digestive vacuoles.
