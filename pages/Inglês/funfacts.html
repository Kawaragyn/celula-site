        Now that we understand the structure and basic functions of the animal cell, it's interesting to note that it also holds several curiosities
        that make it even more fascinating. Some details go beyond what we learn in books and show how complex and
        surprising cellular life is. Take a look:

        <li class="li-distance">Did you know that there are more cells in your body than there are stars in our galaxy?</li>
        <li class="li-distance">The animal cell was discovered in 1665 by Robert Hooke. </li>
        <li class="li-distance">Cells die, but some don't; these are the ones that give rise to cancer.</li>
        <li class="li-distance">If the DNA of a human cell were completely uncoiled, it would measure about 2 meters.</li>
        <li class="li-distance">There are cells that are visible to the naked eye, like an egg yolk, which is an unfertilized egg!</li>
        <li class="li-distance">Cells can see! Some have a type of "eye" that allows them to detect information from a certain distance.</li>
        <li class="li-distance">There are cells that eat your brain and control your mind! These are Toxoplasma, which causes behavioral changes in its hosts.</li>
        <li class="li-distance">There are more bacteria in the body than human cells. </li>
        <li class="li-distance">The first cells to exist were prokaryotes! These are nothing more than cells that lack a nucleus. </li>
        <li class="li-distance">Cells commit suicide; they self-destruct through a process called apoptosis. </li>
        <li class="li-distance">Some animals have cells that emit light, such as fireflies and some deep-sea fish (these fish live at very great depths where sunlight cannot reach). </li>
        <li class="li-distance">The cells in our bodies communicate with each other through chemical signals, such as hormones and neurotransmitters. </li>

            <h1>Quizzes</h1>
            <p class="quest">
            Now that you've learned more about animal cells, how about taking a quick and easy quiz to test your new knowledge? (The answer key is at the end of the page.)
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Question 1</h2>
            <p class="quiz"> Regarding the animal cell, mark the incorrect alternative. <br>
            (a) The animal cell, like all cell types, has a plasma membrane and cytoplasm. <br>
            (b) The animal cell is a eukaryotic cell, therefore, having a nucleus and membranous organelles, such as the chloroplast. <br>
            (c) The animal cell has lysosomes, an organelle related to intracellular digestion. <br>
            (d) The animal cell differs from the bacterial cell by having, for example, cellular organelles, such as mitochondria. <br>
            (e) As in all cell types, in the animal cell, the plasma membrane provides selective permeability, controlling what enters and what leaves the cell. <br>
            </p>

            <h2>Question 2</h2>
            <p class="quiz">
            All of the structures described below can be observed in an animal cell, except: <br>
            (a) Mitochondria <br>
            (b) Lysosome <br>
            (c) Ribosome <br>
            (d) Plastid <br>
            (e) Golgi apparatus
            </p>

            <h2>Question 3</h2>
            <p class="quiz">
            Which cell organelle is found only in animal cells? <br>
            (a) Mitochondria <br>
            (b) Ribosome <br>
            (c) Lysosome <br>
            (d) Chloroplast <br>
            (e) Golgi apparatus
            </p>

            <h2>Question 4</h2>
            <p class="quiz">
            Regarding the animal cell, mark the alternative Incorrect statement: <br>
            (a) The animal cell is a type of eukaryotic cell. <br>
            (b) The animal cell does not have chloroplasts, a structure typical of plant cells. <br>
            (c) Animal cells have membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria, which are responsible for the process of cellular respiration. <br>
            (d) Centrioles, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes are organelles present in animal cells. <br>
            (e) The cellulose cell wall is not found in all types of animal cells; it is only found in skin cells, which require greater resistance. </p>

            <h2>Question 5</h2>
            <p class="quiz"> In a biology test, a student came across the following figure: </p>
            <p><img src="../../images/1-celula.webp" alt="Plant Cell" width="40%"></p>
            <p class="quiz">
            Analyzing the drawing, the student concluded that it is not an animal cell, because the cell above: <br>
            (a) does not have a cell wall. <br>
            (b) is eukaryotic. <br>
            (c) has characteristics typical of a plant cell, such as chloroplasts and a central vacuole. <br>
            (d) has characteristics that indicate it is a photosynthetic prokaryotic cell, as it has chloroplasts. <br>
            (e) does not have characteristics exclusive to animal cells, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. </section>
