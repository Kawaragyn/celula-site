        Now that we understand the basic structure and functions of the animal cell, it's interesting to note that it also holds several curiosities
        that make it even more fascinating. Some details go beyond what we learn in books and show how complex and
        surprising cellular life is. Take a look:

        <li>Did you know that there are more cells in your body than stars in our galaxy?</li>
        <li>The animal cell was discovered in 1665 by Robert Hooke.</li>
        <li>Cells die, but some don't; these are the ones that give rise to cancer.</li>
        <li>If the DNA from a human cell were completely uncoiled, it would measure about 2 meters.</li>
        <li>There are cells that are visible to the naked eye, such as the yolk of an egg, which is one that hasn't been fertilized!</li>
        <li>Cells can see! Some have a type of "eye" that allows them to detect information from a certain distance.</li>
        <li>There are cells that eat your brain and control your mind! They are Toxoplasmas, which cause behavioral changes in their hosts.</li>
        <li>There are more bacteria in the body than human cells.</li>
        <li>The first cells to exist were prokaryotes! Which are nothing more than cells that do not have a nucleus.</li>
        <li>Cells commit suicide, they self-destruct through a process called apoptosis.</li>
        <li>Some animals have cells that emit light, such as fireflies and some abyssal fish (these fish live in very deep waters where sunlight doesn't reach).</li>
        <li>The cells in our body communicate with each other through chemical signals, such as hormones and neurotransmitters.</li>

            <h1>Quizzes</h1>
            <p>
                Now that you've learned more about the Animal Cell, how about taking a quick and easy quiz to test your new knowledge?
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Question 1</h2>
            <p> About the animal cell, mark the incorrect alternative. <br>
                (a) The animal cell, as well as all cell types, has a plasma membrane and cytoplasm. <br>
                (b) The animal cell is a eukaryotic type of cell, therefore having a nucleus and membranous organelles, such as the chloroplast. <br>
                (c) The animal cell has lysosomes, an organelle related to intracellular digestion. <br>
                (d) The animal cell differs from the bacterial cell by having, for example, cellular organelles, such as the mitochondrion. <br>
                (e) As in all cell types, in the animal cell, the plasma membrane provides selective permeability, controlling what enters and exits the cell. <br>
